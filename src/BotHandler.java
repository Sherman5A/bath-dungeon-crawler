// stores the output of the look in memory. Perform turns based off of that
// looks once at edge of that look
// keep on until interesting stuff is found. When interesting stuff is found, get it
// If player in sight always chase them.
// if down, go down, if side, go to side, very simple pathfinding
// if not in sight, remember player direction and travel in that direction
// that should be enough.
